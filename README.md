Cross browser extension to block annoying privacy popups

___


# How does it work?
This extension has a block-list of CSS rules that target privacy pop ups. As soon as a webpage loads, the extension deploys special CSS rules to give you back the control of the webpage, by removing any privacy pop up modal or notification.
